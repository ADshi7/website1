	  <h2>About</h2>
	  <p> Welcome to the experience of this website, where we bring in the idea of being able to build your own closet and gather the latest and most wanted inspiration in fashion. Each following week, a new lineup is added and new clothing is updated so that new items can be discovered so that you stay up to date. 

As you wake up, not knowing what to wear, take a quick stroll on our website and discover what matches with what, as well as the latest in fashion. 

The purpose of this website is to function like an old magazine catalogue as well as having a built-in closet where you get to pick your favourite items and how you yourself would match the different pieces together to create your own outfit. We have also created a supportive community for both fashion lovers and even just people who want to stay on track with what is new and popular.

It focuses on the clothing rather than who is wearing it.

Online shopping without the spending 

Online window shopping 

Prices and online shopping can sometimes be stressful in the sense that there is an empty cart or a full cart waiting for you. This website was created with the intent of removing all the worries when it comes to shipping and prices. None of these particular items need to be purchased, but instead take inspiration on. Users can decide for  themselves if they want to make some of these particular items, or even go out of their way to look for what is similar or even the exact items themselves. This makes it more responsive and fun as in today’s society, it has become so easy to just add to cart and swipe up from someone you have seen online. We are trying to bring back the excitement of scrolling and searching and looking at what is new. We want to bring back the extra steps of looking through a magazine and catalogue but instead of calling the number for what you want you yourself decide what is next.
